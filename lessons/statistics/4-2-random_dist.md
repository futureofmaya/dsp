[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

**Exercise 4.2** The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

**From Metis:** This question asks you to examine the function that produces random numbers. Is it really random? A good way to test that is to examine the pmf and cdf of the list of random numbers and visualize the distribution. If you're not sure what pmf is, read more about it in Chapter 3.

```python
#making list of 1000 random numbers
randoms = []
for i in range(1000):
    randoms.append(thinkstats2.random.random())

#plotting PMF of random numbers
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(randoms, label='random numbers pmf')
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='randomly generated number', ylabel='probability')
```

```python
#plotting CDF of random numbers
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(randoms)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf, label='random numbers cdf')
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='randomly generated number', ylabel='probability')
thinkplot.Show()
```

After plotting 1000 random numbers, we can see that while the pmf is approaching uniformity, it is not entirely uniform. As the sample size approaches infinity, the pmf approaches uniformity. It's easier to see this when the sample size is smaller, like 10: 

```python
#making list of 10 random numbers
randoms = []
for i in range(10):
    randoms.append(thinkstats2.random.random())

#plotting PMF of random numbers
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(randoms, label='random numbers pmf')
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='randomly generated number', ylabel='cdf')
```

```python
#plotting CDF of random numbers
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(randoms)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf, label='random numbers cdf')
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='randomly generated number', ylabel='cdf')
thinkplot.Show()
```

Note: These images are from one execution of the code. If I were to execute it again, they would like slightly different, because the code is not seeded.
